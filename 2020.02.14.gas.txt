With highways available, driving a car from Hangzhou to any other
city is easy. But since the tank capacity of a car is limited, we
have to find gas stations on the way from time to time. Different gas
station may give different price. You are asked to carefully design
the cheapest route to go.

Each input file contains one test case. For each case, the first
line contains 4 positive numbers: Cmax (<= 100), the maximum
capacity of the tank; D (<=30000), the distance between Hangzhou
and the destination city; Davg (<=20), the average distance per unit
gas that the car can run; and N (<= 500), the total number of gas
stations. Then N lines follow, each contains a pair of non-negative
numbers: Pi, the unit gas price, and Di (<=D), the distance between
between this station and Hangzhou, for i=1,...N. All the numbers in a
line are separated by a space.

For each test case, print the cheapest price in a line, accurate up
to 2 decimal places. It is assumed that the tank is empty at the
beginning. If it is impossible to reach the destination, print “The
maximum travel distance = X” where X is the maximum possible distance
the car can run, accurate up to 2 decimal places.
